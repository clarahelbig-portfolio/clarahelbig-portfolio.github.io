      "The Nicholas and Andrei Tooth Travelling Scholarship presents Law, Land & Loneliness, a new body of work by artist Amber Hahn which brings together two months of investigative research in the United States. Informed by dialogue with The Center for Land Use Interpretation, Intrepid Potash and Utah Department of Natural Resources. The work concentrates on examining the anthropogenic landscape phenomenology occurring around Wendover, Utah.

Intrepid Potash LLC is an extractive industry working on the Bonneville salt flats in an area once known as the Salduro Salt Marsh, which has been surface mined, using solar evaporation, for potash since World War I. Intrepid’s operation, extracts primarily potash and magnesium chloride, for use in fertilizers, dust suppression, and other industrial operations. Intrepid has been withdrawing brine and constructing surface-drainage barriers which have altered the hydrologic environment and have had a profound effect on the salt crust.

Pages from Intrepid’s annual financial report and product specification sheets are displayed on the walls. Chosen for their representation of environmental law and chemical elements they are offered to be interpreted and understood in conjunction with the performances.
<p>
Choreography, delivered by Ruby Embley and Yanaëlle Thiran proposes to traverse geological and sensual fields of knowledge and experience. As a way of offering different modes of thinking about global issues that can transition into one another and contribute to the design of an elemental ethics capable of dissolving forms, both juridical and discursive, that support global capital’s extractive practices.

Speakers emit audio made by composer Jennifer Walton. Granular synthesis and physical modelling techniques have been used to create textures alongside spectral effects applied to rhythmic elements. Field recordings, gathered from Intrepid Potash are incorporated including a conversation with plant manager Eric Rogers, the sound depicts a landscape of sorting, dispatch, and abandonment that materializes abstract calculations of value.
